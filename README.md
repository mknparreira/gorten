# Gorten

Gorten is a project for education purposes developed for me in Golang, designed to implement a checkout service for an e-commerce marketplace platform. This project aims to provide a practical learning experience by covering essential components of an e-commerce system, including:

- **Infrastructure Setup**: Implementing RabbitMQ for messaging, Kubernetes and MongoDB for data storage.
- **Core Resources**: Developing several resources such as User, Company, Category, Product, Order, Payment, and Shopping Cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Handling the finalization of purchases.
- **API Enhancements**: Focusing on security, resilience, and scalability improvements.
- **Monitoring and Documentation**: Implementing tracing, monitoring and documenting the API with OpenAPI specification (Swagger).
- **Future features**: Planning for additional features and improvements.

The Gorten project aims to demonstrate practical applications of Golang in building robust and scalable e-commerce solutions while offering hands-on experience with modern software practices and technologies.

## Architecture

### RabbitMQ

[![RabbitMQ Diagram](docs/rabbitmq.png)](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/TP7DIWCn483lUOhOYtfe7w07gTH51AbLwgrGOcPQ1xgJc1-nRo-RtQKZgSUTVD-m7xE8oOIKswEw0jmJetvhbflxrUDpewrhlMFafDIrVkXVyST-6ZvWL6TkuW9Ws8rFMxxPd3pEDL10csudsaJzqY7DG4ZN1mVPfjfEpfFjvNNFNDBP9TgJDOaSrplsXbqU_c0bo76J2FlAc2zLsO0c8PmZbltWjUDht1iIxDfG3H9_8oSNJhlimIGi-DCuV2-pIiBMq74dQsFnccukqs9HHTW7CH0Velfp0ZsTtjKzUgvBncoehXtP9OMkMwdnK5Aeouest7rc012sF7xc0e5Iiadk-xTuWGovFVu2)

#### Overview

This section provides explains the exchanges, queues, and bindings that are configured, and describes the flow of messages through the system.

##### Exchanges

**order_exchange**
**Description:** Responsible for routing messages related to order events. For example, an order creation event with the routing key order.created will be routed to the order_created queue.

**product_exchange**
**Description:** Handles messages related to product events. For example, a message with the routing key product.added or product.updated will be routed to the inventory_update queue, enabling the system to handle various product-related events using pattern matching.

**notification_exchange**
**Description:** Use case: when a notification event occurs, it will be sent to all queues bound to this exchange, such as the email_notifications queue.

##### Queues

**order_created**
**Description:** This queue stores messages related to the creation of orders.

**order_paid**
**Description:** This queue stores messages related to the payment of orders.

**inventory_update**
**Description:** This queue stores messages related to inventory updates, such as when a product is added or updated.

**email_notifications**
**Description:** This queue stores messages related to email notifications, which could be triggered by various events.

##### Bindings

Binding from order_exchange to queue order_created

**Routing Key:** order.created

**Description:** When a new order is created in the system, an event with the routing key order.created is published to the order_exchange. This binding ensures that the event is routed to the order_created queue, where it can be processed by a consumer that handles new order creation logic, such as sending a confirmation email or updating the order management system.

Binding from order_exchange to order_paid

**Routing Key:** order.paid

**Description:** When an order is marked as paid, an event with the routing key order.paid is published to the order_exchange. This binding ensures that the event is routed to the order_paid queue, where it can be processed by a consumer that handles order payment logic, such as updating the order status in the database or triggering shipment processes.

Binding from product_exchange to inventory_update

**Routing Key:** product.added, product.updated

**Description:** When a new product is added or an existing product is updated in the system, events with routing keys product.added or product.updated are published to the product_exchange. This binding ensures that these events are routed to the inventory_update queue, where they can be processed by a consumer that updates the inventory system, ensuring that stock levels and product details are accurate and up to date.

Binding from notification_exchange to email_notifications

**Description:** When a notification event occurs, such as a user signing up or an order being shipped, the event is published to the notification_exchange. This binding ensures that the event is routed to the email_notifications queue, where it can be processed by a consumer that sends out email notifications to users, keeping them informed about the status of their orders or other important updates.

# 2. RabbitMQ Installation

To set up RabbitMQ for this project, we've provided an automated shell script that configures the necessary exchanges, queues, and bindings. Follow the instructions below to get RabbitMQ up and running.

**Running the Setup Script**
The setup script (setup-rabbitmq.sh) is designed to be executed automatically when the RabbitMQ container starts. This script performs the following actions:

- Waits for RabbitMQ to Start: The script waits until RabbitMQ's management API is available before proceeding with configuration.
- Creates an Admin User: A dedicated RabbitMQ admin user (rabbitmq_admin) is created with the specified password.
- Configures Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings: The script declares all necessary exchanges, queues, and bindings as required by the application.

**Environment Variables**

```env
RABBITMQ_USER: Username for the RabbitMQ admin user (default: rabbitmq_admin).
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD: Password for the RabbitMQ admin user (default: my_password).
RABBITMQ_HOST: Hostname for RabbitMQ (default: localhost).
RABBITMQ_PORT: Management API port (default: 15672).
WAIT_TIME: (default:10)
```

To override these defaults, you can set the environment variables in your .env file.

# 14. Enhance API Resilience

In this phase, I will implement some strategies to improve the resilience of APIs, ensuring they can handle with failures and recover effectively. I will adopting the following strategies and tools:

- Implement Circuit Breaker using Circuit Breaker package in Kong API Gateway.
- Implement Circuit Breaker using Hystrix-Go package.
- Implement retries e backoff using Retry-Go package.
- Configure timeout into the entire services in Kong API Gateway
- Implement Fallback Pattern using Go-Fallback or Resilience4j package (Iâ€™m not sure yet).
- Implement Bulkheads.
- Implement Active Health Checks in Kong API Gateway
- Implement Failover strategies with Kubernetes (replicaSet)

# 15. Enhance API Scalability

To ensure API Scalability and can handle increasing demand effectively, I will adopting the following strategies and tools:

- Implement Load Balancing with Kubernetes
- Implement Caching with Redis
- Implement Rate Limiting Using the Kong Plugin

# 16. Monitoring & Tracing

This phase I will integrating monitoring through the entire system to ensure visibility and performance management. The goal is to provide real-time insights, track system health, and identify potential issues early by monitoring various metrics, logs, and events across all services. This will help in maintaining system reliability and performance.

- Implement monitoring across all services (I havenÂ´t chosen the application yet)
- Implement Distributed Tracing with Jaeger

# 17. The Open API Documentation

In this phase, the OpenAPI documentation will be created for every API within the project. This documentation will serve as a detailed reference with all available endpoints, request and response formats, and authentication methods by using the OpenAPI specifications.

- Provide The OpenAPI Documentation with Swagger for All APIs
