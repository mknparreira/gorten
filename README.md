# Gorten

Gorten is a project for education purposes developed in Golang, designed to implement a checkout service for an e-commerce marketplace platform. This project aims to provide a practical learning experience by covering essential components of an e-commerce system, including:

- **Infrastructure Setup**: Implementing RabbitMQ for messaging and MongoDB for data storage.
- **Core Resources**: Developing several resources such as User, Company, Category, Product, Order, Payment, and Shopping Cart.
- **Checkout Process**: Handling the finalization of purchases.
- **API Enhancements**: Focusing on security, resilience, and scalability improvements.
- **Monitoring and Documentation**: Implementing monitoring and documenting the API with OpenAPI specifications.
- **Future features**: Planning for additional features and improvements.

The Gorten project aims to demonstrate practical applications of Golang in building robust and scalable e-commerce solutions while offering hands-on experience with modern software practices and technologies.

# 13. Enhance API Resilience

In this phase, I will implement some strategies to improve the resilience of APIs, ensuring they can handle with failures and recover effectively. I will adopting the following strategies and tools:

- Implement Circuit Breaker using Hystrix-Go package.
- Implement retries e backoff using Retry-Go package.
- Configure timeout into the entire services in Kong API Gateway
- Implement Fallback Pattern using Go-Fallback or Resilience4j package (Iâ€™m not sure yet).
- Implement Bulkheads.

# 14. Enhance API Scalability

To ensure API Scalability and can handle increasing demand effectively, I will adopting the following strategies and tools:

- Implement Load Balancing with Kubernetes
- Implement Caching with Redis
- Implement Rate Limiting Using the Kong Plugin

# 15. Monitoring

This phase I will integrating monitoring through the entire system to ensure visibility and performance management. The goal is to provide real-time insights, track system health, and identify potential issues early by monitoring various metrics, logs, and events across all services. This will help in maintaining system reliability and performance.

- Implement monitoring across all services

# 16. The Open API Documentation

In this phase, the OpenAPI documentation will be created for every API within the project. This documentation will serve as a detailed reference with all available endpoints, request and response formats, and authentication methods by using the OpenAPI specifications.

- Provide The OpenAPI Documentation for All APIs

# 17. Future features

| Feature    | Description                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Kubernetes | Implements Service Register |
| Jenkins    | Implements CI-CD            |
