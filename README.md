# Gorten
My project in Golang implements a checkout service for an e-commerce platform. This is for study purposes.

## Architecture
Through the API Gateway, it will be implemented a service discovery and rate limit.
Also, there will be a circuit breaker with a fallback.
All APIs will be authenticated.
All APIs will be caching with Redis.
The data will be recorded in MongoDB.
All apps will be running into Docker.

## Roadmap
This project will be split into the following phases:
1. Installation + Configuration
2. Infra
3. User resource
4. Category resource
5. Product resource
6. Company resource
7. Order resource
8. Rate Limit + Circuit breaker + fallback
9. Monitoring
10. Open API Documentation 
11. Future features
